# 1. Write a small program where the user can enter a name and phone number until he enters "exit".
# Save the data in a dictionary and save it to a file using both the json and pickle module, use a variable to decide what library should do the serialization.
# Inspect the files afterwards.
# Let the user chose an mode at start of the program if he wants to input data or search for phone numbers by name.
# 2. Catch exceptions like searching for a name that is not in the phonebook
# 3. Modify your program to use an object oriented approach for the data structure. Instead of using a dict save your data using classes
# Example classes could be contact, name, phone number. Think of what attributes these classes might have
