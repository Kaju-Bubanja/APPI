# 1. Write a small program where the user can enter a name and phone number until
# they enter "exit". Save the data in a dictionary and save it to a file using both
# the json and pickle module, use a variable to decide what library should do the serialization.
# Inspect the files afterwards.
# Let the user chose a mode at start of the program if they want to input data or
# search for phone numbers by name.
# 2. Catch exceptions like searching for a name that is not in the phonebook
# 3(optional). Modify your program to use an object oriented approach for the data structure.
# Instead of using a dict to save your data use classes
# Example classes could be contact, name, phone number. 
# Think of what attributes these classes might have
